## Hurricane Donna Metadata

The information displayed below is all of the primary sources included within our exhibition! This collection of materials include: Newspapers, Photographs, Health Notes, and Personal Accounts/Statements. All of these are valuable because it brings historians and readers closer to understanding the pain that these people all underwent after suffering through the storm.

All of this data can be easily dowloaded and exported into an Excel or Google Sheets file if you would like to look at the bigger picture!
