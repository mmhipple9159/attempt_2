## When did Hurricane Donna hit?

Hurricane Donna hit Florida for the first time on September 10, 1960, causing irreparable damage to the state. It started by hitting the Florida Keys and then it slowly made its way up the state on the west coast hitting Fort Myers and Naples. Then it swayed towards the middle of Florida, hitting Orlando, then it continued on towards the north, hitting the Eastern United States, until it eventually fizzled out in the northern section of the Atlantic Ocean.

## What is the goal of this exhibition?

This collection features pictures and newspapers highlighting what happened when Hurricane Donna hit Florida. Focusing on the more tragic aspects of this event, the goal of this exhibition is to call attention to the mass amounts of flooding that people dealt with as well as showcase how much damage was caused in the aftermath of the event. 

## What types of materials are included in this collection?

It is mostly consisting of newpapers and photographs but we collected a large amount of personal accounts and health records from the Collier County Museum as well. Our researchers have worked diligently in order to ensure everything captured in this collection highlights the accounts of real people who lived in Florida during the storm and suffered through the effects that such a powerful hurricane had on the once bright state of Florida. 

The template repository features four objects from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital).
