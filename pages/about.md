## What is the goal of this exhibition?

The Hurricane Donna exhibition features pictures and newspapers highlighting what happened when the storm hit Florida in 1960. Focusing on the more tragic aspects of this event, the goal of this exhibition is to call attention to the mass amounts of flooding that people dealt with as well as showcase how much damage was caused in the aftermath of the event. 

## What Happened?

Hurricane Donna hit Florida for the first time on September 10, 1960, causing irreparable damage to the state. It started by hitting the Florida Keys and then it slowly made its way up the state on the west coast hitting Fort Myers and Naples. Then it swayed towards the middle of Florida, hitting Orlando, then it continued on towards the north, hitting the Eastern United States, until it eventually fizzled out in the northern section of the Atlantic Ocean. With about 270 people injured in Collier County alone, and 12 people killed altogether within the state of Florida, it is safe to say that this storm had an impact. While we are not sure how much aid that Florida got in the aftermath of the disaster, we do know that the damages totaled nearly $300 million. Hurricane Donna hurt and damaged many peoples' lives, so it is now time to shed light on those lives lost by displaying our collection online.


## What types of materials are included in this collection?

It is mostly consisting of newpapers and photographs but we collected a large amount of personal accounts and health records from the Collier County Museum as well. Our researchers have worked diligently in order to ensure everything captured in this collection highlights the accounts of real people who lived in Florida during the storm and suffered through the effects that such a powerful hurricane had on the once bright state of Florida.
